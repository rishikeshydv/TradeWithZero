This is an easy way of dealing immutability in OCaml. Here, we create a reference to the mutable
variable.


let count = ref 0      //here, count is mutable as it keeps the reference

let count_requests inner_handler request =
  count := !count + 1;
  inner_handler request



  The other approach is using a pattern-matching through recursive functions.
